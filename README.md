# React Landing Page Project

This project serves as a learning exercise aimed at refreshing and solidifying fundamental concepts of React while gaining insights into the structure of a landing page.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to deepen understanding of React by applying it to a practical scenario. By building a landing page, we aim to:

- Review and reinforce React fundamentals such as components, props, and state management.
- Gain familiarity with React Router for handling navigation within a single-page application.
- Practice structuring and styling components to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional landing page.
- Explore best practices for organizing React projects and managing dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the landing page.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Leveraged for interactivity and dynamic content rendering.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical React project structure, with components organized into a logical hierarchy for modularity and reusability. Key directories and files include:

- **src/components**: Contains individual React components used to build the landing page.
- **src/App.js**: The main component serving as the entry point for the application.
- **src/index.js**: The JavaScript file that renders the React application into the DOM.
- **public/index.html**: The HTML file serving as the root template for the application.

## Getting Started
